# Infix To Postfix

`LINK TO UNEDITED, ORIGINAL PROJECT (written on a 50 min time crunch):` https://github.com/ThomasDanger/InfixToPostfix-unedited

## Preface/Background 
This is an expansion of a program originially written by Fatima Khalid and Thomas Conner with the goal of increased performance and better documentation. The original version of this code was written as part of an in-class assignment for a Computer Science II class at the University of Texas at Dallas on October 5, 2022

## Description
This program utilizes a specialized stack datastructure to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression. In the current build, this will only convert an infix expression to a postfix expression.

## Going Forward
In the near future, I hope to create a program that will convert to prefix and evaluate these expressions if requested
